## Airport

### General info
Stockholm Arlanda Airport is the busiest airport in Sweden and the third busiest in the Nordic countries. It is located between Stockholm and Uppsala, 37 km from Stockholm. The airport opened in 1959. Arlanda is a major hub for Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Novair. 

### Runways
Arlanda has three runways: Runway 1 (01L/19), runway 2 (08/26) and runway 3 (01R/19L). Runway 1 is the longest at 10,830 ft and it can handle takeoffs and landings of the heaviest aircrafts in use. Runways 2 and 3 are 8,202 ft long. The parallel runways 1 and 3 can handle simultaneous takeoffs and landings in both VMC and IMC, although using one runway for departures and the other for arrivals. Parallel approaches are possible and planned for the future, but not used today, since the traffic volumes do not motivate the increased complexity.

### Instrument procedures
All SIDs and STARs are RNAV and include both altitude and speed restrictions, although descent clearances are given by ATC. 

**SIDs:**
There are many exit points for SIDs, and each of them can be reached from any runway. All SIDs end within Stockholm TMA, from the exit points the aircraft are expected to either join an airway or to join an FRA Connecting Route out of the TMA (not implemented).

**STARs:**
There are only four entry points for STARs, one for each cardinal point, and any runway can be reached from any entry point. There are two different sets of STARs, for high and low traffic density. During high traffic density the used STARs all end in holding patterns from which the aircraft are manually vectored to final. During low traffic the STARs lead the aircraft directly onto final, these are optimized for noise abatement.
