Pulkovo Airport, formally Fyodor Dostoyevsky International Airport (IATA: LED, ICAO: ULLI) is an international airport serving St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city. With slightly above [18 mln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_Russia) passengers served in 2018, it is Russia's 4th busiest airport. Pulkovo is the only airport in Russia that uses QNH and altitudes in feet below TRL (others use QFE and meters).

Pulkovo serves as the hub for Rossiya Airlines (ICAO: SDM).

### Airspace

Pulkovo has two nested CTAs:
- inner one from 1000 ft AMSL up to FL080 in control of Pulkovo-Krug (Radar),
- outer one from 3000 ft AMSL up to FL265 in control of Peterburg-Approach.

Pulkovo CTR's upper bound is 1500 ft AMSL. All these airspaces are C-class. Transition altitude is 3500 ft.

Besides the main airport, the outer CTA includes several minor airfields which are not used for passenger flights. Two of them, Gorelovo and Pushkin, are located in the vicinity of Pulkovo as well as two helipads.

### Standard operations

#### Runway usage

The airport has two parallel runways: 10L/28R and 10R/28L. With both runways in operation, 10L/28R is used for departures and 10R/28L for arrivals. The distance between runways allows segregated parallel operations. During the night (20-04 UTC) only 10R/28L should be used for both arrivals and departures due to noise abatement procedures, if weather and traffic permit.

#### Departures

Aircraft normally follow one of the published SIDs. Initial climb is 3500 ft.

#### Arrivals

Aircraft usually descend according to published STARs though may be directed to initial fix if traffic permits.

[Point merge system](https://www.eurocontrol.int/concept/point-merge) (PMS) is used to reduce the need for vectoring: aircraft are instructed to proceed direct to the merge point (OBARI/ARNAT for 28X runways, LEPTO/GEBKA for 10X runways) from one of sequencing legs.

All runways allow ILS approach:
- 10L: ILS CAT IIIA
- 10R: ILS CAT II
- 28L: ILS CAT I
- 28R: ILS CAT IIIA

All runways are also GLC CAT I certified.
