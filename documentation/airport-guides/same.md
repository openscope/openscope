# SAME - Mendoza El Plumerillo International Airport

## About SAME
Governor Francisco Gabrielli International Airport (IATA: MDZ, ICAO: SAME), better known as El Plumerillo International Airport, is located 11 kilometers northeast of the center of Mendoza, capital of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. The airport is Argentina's 4th busiest airport by passenger numbers and is also home to the 8th Mountain Infantry Brigade of the Argentine Army and the 4th Air Brigade of the Argentine Air Force, both located on the south side of the field, known as El Plumerillo Military Air Base. The airport serves the Mendoza Province with 12 domestic routes within Argentina and 4 international routes to Chile, Brazil, Peru and Panama.

## About the Mendoza TMA
The Mendoza Terminal Maneuvering Area controls a very large area surrounding the city of Mendoza from the surface up to FL245. It borders the San Rafael TMA to the South, the San Juan TMA to the North and the Santiago TMA to the West. The Western half of the airspace is home to extreme terrain, almost as high as the airspace itself, providing an extra challenge to aircraft and air traffic control. The Aconcagua, the world's second most prominent mountain and the highest mountain in the Western and Southern hemispheres is located just 60nm West of El Plumerillo.

## Instrument Procedures
Like most airports in Argentina, departure procedures take aircraft around an arc around the Mendoza VOR (DOZ) to the outbound radials to their departure waypoints. In recent years however, RNAV procedures were introduced which omit the arc as it is not necessary for most departures. Due to the extremely challenging terrain West of Mendoza, all departures to the West first fly East to gain some altitude before turning back around, flying over the airport and onwards over the Andes. All STARs are RNAV and guide aircraft around restricted airspace and terrain to the initial approach fixes. Aircraft are usually then cleared to the RNAV approach for the appropriate runway.
