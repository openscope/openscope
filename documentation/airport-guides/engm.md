### About this facility
Oslo TMA, Røyken, Norway
237,618 annual operations in 2016 (Reported by Avinor)

The Oslo TMA is one of three sectors of the Oslo Kontrollsentral (ATCC), responsible for all airspace in Eastern Norway. The Oslo ATCC is located 30km from Oslo and 65km Southwest of Oslo Gardemoen Airport (ENGM).

### Airspace
the Oslo TMA consists of Class C airspace (equivalent to American class B airspace) which covers a large area on top of Akershus County and the Oslo metropolitan area up to FL215. it also includes a small shelf to the South with a floor of FL115; below this, the airspace is ceded to the Tarris TMA

### Instrument Procedures
The procedures are quite modern for a European airport. All SID's and STAR's are RNAV and include both altitude and speed restrcitions. Oslo was also the first airport in the world to adopt a point merge system, minimizing conflicts between departing and arriving aircraft as well as reducing fuel consumption. Once within the point merge arches, aircraft can be given shortucts or vectors to join the ILS approach.
